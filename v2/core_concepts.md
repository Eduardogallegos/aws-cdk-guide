This topic describes some of the concepts \(the why and how\) behind the AWS CDK\. It also discusses the AWS Construct Library\.

AWS CDK apps are composed of building blocks known as [Constructs](constructs.md), which are composed together to form [stacks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.Stack.html) and [apps](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.App.html)\.
