# AWS CDK Developer Guide history<a name="doc-history"></a>

See [Releases](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-cdk/releases) for information about AWS CDK releases\. The AWS CDK is updated approximately once a week\. Maintenance versions may be released between weekly releases to address critical issues\. Each release includes a matched AWS CDK Toolkit \(CDK CLI\), AWS Construct Library, and API Reference\. Updates to this Guide generally do not synchronize with AWS CDK releases\.
